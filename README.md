# My Awesome Project
This is my version of one of the landing pages for PSCU.

**Link to project:** https://super-sable-5addb9.netlify.app/


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Fontawesome, Bootstrap 5

I created this landing page using mainly HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5. I mostly used custom styling unless I ran into something that would just take too long for me to code myself and that's when I would use Bootstrap. For example, I used Bootstrap for the accordion and the Carousel. I used JavaScript for the client side Validation. 

## Optimizations
I would definitely improve the form if I had more time to do so. I feel like there are some positioning issues that was giving me problems, especially when I was doing the validation. 

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.

I am so used to doing custom styling that I forgot how tricky Bootstrap can be when you are trying to override their styling. I had fun workin on the validation even though I was running into a few roadblocks. I chose to use some regex and I definitely struggled with it! But I think I got the functionality to do what I wanted it to.
